# Measuring pulse rate by analysing micro changes in head motion
This project estimates pulse rate from a video stream by measuring face micro motion. It uses the open source vision library, opencv, to process video streams

## Pre-requisites (Mac Laptop)
1. Python 3 installed (3.7 version minimum)
2. Webcam

## Pre-requisites RaspberryPi
1. Raspberry Pi 3b+
2. Raspberry Pi camera. (picamera) (USB cameras are not supported )
3. Python 3 installed (3.5 version minimum)


## Software installation steps
1. Clone this repositary to a local directory
2. `cd VideoMotion`
3. `python3 -m venv venv`  (Create a virtual environment)
4. `source venv/bin/activate` (Activate virtual environment)
5. Install the following python packages
    1. `pip install opencv-contrib-python`
    2. `pip install matplotlib`
    3. `pip install scipy`
6. Locate the opencv face classifier *haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml* and copy it to the data folder. (Different distros of opencv install this in different places)  
    1. `mkdir data`
    2. `cp /....../cv2/data/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml data/`  
    
### For the raspberry pi do the additional:
1.`sudo apt-get install at-spi2-core` (remove errors about â€œorg.freedesktop.DBus.Error)

2.`pip install picamera`
    
    
## Usage
1. To verify the installation and camera: `python play_video.py` Verify that video streams and that the camera is correctly positioned for face detection. To exit, move focus to the video window and press 'q'.

2. To measure pulse rate run `python main.py`. When a face is detected, a 'green' rectangle will enclose the face and after about 10 seconds the pulse rate will be displayed over the video if it can be estimated. To exit, move focus to the video window and press 'q', then press <Enter>

3. Optionally use `python main.py video_file.mov` to process a video file

## Options
The configuration file config.txt contains the following options. (Note this is organized as a python dictionary so take care when editing)

1. **low_pulse_bpm** - Low end of pulse rate, (beats-per-minute)
2. **high_pulse_bpm** - Low end of pulse rate, (beats-per-minute)
3. **video_fps** - Preferred video frame rate. (Not all cameras will honor this, doesn't apply to video files)
4. **resolution** - Video resolution
5. **pulse_sample_frames** - Number of frames to capture and process
6. **show_pulse_charts** - When `True` charts of the head motion will show: 
    1. The raw changes in head motion over time
    2. The filtered changes in head motion over time using **low_pulse_bpm/high_pulse_bpm**
    3. The FFT of the filtered changes
7. **feature_method** When `face`, the algorithm uses face detection followed by face tracking to measure motion. When `selectROI` The user can select a region of interest to track)
8. **pause_between_samples** When `True`, processing will pause between samples. This is to allow charts to be examined. Press `Enter` to resume
